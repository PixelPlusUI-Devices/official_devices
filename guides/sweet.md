## About ROMs
We have two types of Custom ROMs on the Redmi Note 10 Pro / Pro Max

• MIUI Vendor Based ROM

• OSS Vendor Based ROM

## What is OSS vendor?
• OSS (which stands for open-source software) vendor allows the developers to modify the vendor to remove MIUI bloat from the vendor and fix any issues by directly modifying the vendor, instead of overlaying it.

## A few things to keep in mind
• Before flashing a MIUI vendor-based ROM, make sure you are on the correct vendor/firmware for YOUR region. You can get flashable ZIPs here so you do not have to the flash MIUI before flashing the ROM (Thanks @grewal) This means, if you have an Indian device variant, flash the with the latest vendor/firmware for India (sweetin). Flashing the wrong vendor will cause different issues such as worse battery drain (due to NFC spam), a green/blue tint in camera (as the Global markets do not have the 64MP device, using that vendor on the 64MP variant will cause such issues)

• If you shift from a MIUI vendor-based ROM to another MIUI vendor-based ROM or to an OSS vendor-based ROM, you do not have to flash the vendor again. However, if you want to switch from an OSS vendor-based ROM to a MIUI vendor-based ROM, you will need to flash the right vendor/firmware for your region.

## PixelPlusUI Based OSS Vendor Or MIUI Vendor ?

• Well PixelPlusUI Based On OSS Vendor.


## A few notes about flashing Custom ROMs
• This is a device with dynamic partitions.

• You should NOT wipe any partition to clean flash a ROM.

## About DFE (Disable Force Encryption)
It is strongly advised to not use this! Anyone with physical access to your phone (for example if lost or stolen) can get all your confidential data, including photos and even saved passwords, and makes identity theft possible.

Whenever possible, back up your data and do a proper encrypted setup!
